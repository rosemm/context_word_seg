\title{Print for dpseg computational model}
\usage{
print_for_dpseg(df, nontext, dir = getwd(),
  save.to = "computational_models", r = 0, quiet = TRUE, iters = 5000)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe with the columns utt, orth, phon and all context columns. See details.}

\item{nontext}{Should utterances be randomly selected for each context column?}

\item{dir}{The directory containing the folder with all model files (colingFinal). This is also the directory where the .sh file will save. Defaults to the working directory.}

\item{save.to}{The name of a directory in which to save the input files.}

\item{r}{A counter variable. This number will appear in the names of input and output files, making it easy to keep track of multiple parallel processes.}

\item{quiet}{Turn on additional messages? Useful for debugging.}
}
\description{
Prepares (saves to text files) phonetic approximations of transcript utterances for use by dpseg computational models.
