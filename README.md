# The Role of Context in Syllable Co-Occurence Patterns for Word Segmentation
coding_scripts.R has the functions research assistants use to code the transcripts. Here are instructions given to RAs working on this:    
Thanks for your help!! I'm excited to have you work on this project. This is a long email, but hopefully it should tell you everything you need to know to get working on this coding project. Please let me know if anything is unclear/confusing, or if you have questions! I love questions. :)     
I saved all of the relevant stuff on the server. Log into the lab server, then open Maier > Transcript Coding Sp15. 
You'll see a couple files in that folder, and a folder called "transcripts". You won't actually edit any of these files directly (R will do it for you, through the coding program); be careful not to edit, move, or delete any files! Feel free to open them, if you like, to take a look. The files in the transcript folder are all in CHAT format, which is the transcription system for the CHILDES database. CHIDLES is a really important resource for researchers working on language acquisition, so it might be fun to take a peep at it if you're curious. :)     
Working on the coding should be pretty easy (I hope! Let me know if you have any trouble with it.) To get started, open the file called "_OPEN_ME.r". If you double-click that file, it should automatically open in R or RStudio (either one is fine - they look different but work the same). It has the instructions for you to start the program. Basically, you'll have to run two lines of code (you can just copy-paste them right from the OPEN_ME file), and then the program will start and you'll see prompts on the screen to guide you through everything. I've attached screenshots to this email that show you what it should look like when you open that file successfully in both R and R Studio.
The program will show you sections of transcript with about 30 lines at a time, and ask you to indicate what the context is. You can enter multiple contexts by separating them with a semicolon. This might be because multiple things are happening simultaneously (e.g. the baby is crying in the bath, so "bath" and "fussing" are both happening at the same time) or it might be because the transcript section you're looking at has more than one thing going on in it sequentially (e.g. baby gets fed, and then afterwards has a bath). You don't need to distinguish between those in your coding - you just enter as many contexts as you identify and separate them by semicolons (e.g. "meal; bath"). You may be wondering, "is there a list of contexts for me to work from?" The answer is "nope!" :) This is supposed to be open-ended. Just go ahead and describe what you think is happening in a couple words. Your descriptions should be very short, though - this makes it easier to code, and it will also make it easier for me to process the data. So something like "talking" is better than "mom is talking with the baby about her stuffed monkey". It should describe a general context or activity, not specifically what's going on in this particular situation. It's okay to have a context that's more than one word (e.g. typing "taking pictures" will work just fine), but again, they should be short, general descriptions.     
It should take maybe 30 seconds to code each transcript section. After each coding decision, the program will ask if you want to code another, and you can type "y" or "yes" to continue. So just keep typing "y" or "yes" after each coding decision to keep working on it. Whenever you're ready to be done, just type "n" or "no" instead, and the program will automatically save your work for you in the coding_doc.txt file. You don't have to save anything yourself. When you quit R, it will ask if you want to save the workspace - you don't.     
Just a heads up: When the program starts you might be prompted to select a "mirror" for downloading packages. This should only happen the first time you run the script on that computer. Just select the closest one, called "USA (OR)". Then a bunch of red text will flash up the screen while it downloads the R packages it needs, then you'll see the program start by printing "Hello and welcome to coding. :)".      
One other thing I want to mention: Nearly all of the transcript sections you'll get will be exactly 30 utterances, but some will be shorter if it's from the end of a transcript. For example, if there are 70 lines in a transcript, the first 30 and the next 30 will be full windows, but the last one will only have 10 utterances. While I was piloting this, there were a couple times where I got samples that were only 1 or 2 utterances long. That's generally not enough to be able to tell what's going on (in which case you just enter "none", as per the directions in the coding program, as you'll see). But sometimes it might be! If you can tell what's happening, go ahead and enter your guess.     
Since you'll both be working with the same files, it's important you don't both code at the same time or you may overwrite each other's work (although I don't think that will be an issue since you have your scheduled times to come in and work on lab stuff, and your time slots aren't at the same time). If you're thinking about coming in to work at a time other than what you've got on the google calendar, please send an email to me and to each other first to give us a heads up.    
Of course, let me know if you have any questions!    
Cheers,
